  abstract = {AI applications pose increasing demands on performance, so it is not surprising that the
era of client-side distributed software is becoming important. On top of many AI appli-
cations already using mobile hardware, and even browsers for computationally demanding
AI applications, we are already witnessing the emergence of client-side (federated) machine
learning algorithms, driven by the interests of large corporations and startups alike. Apart
from mathematical and algorithmic concerns, this trend especially demands new levels of
computational efficiency from client environments. Consequently, this paper deals with
the question of state-of-the-art performance by presenting a comparison study between
native code and different browser-based implementations: JavaScript, ASM.js as well as
WebAssembly on a representative mix of algorithms. Our results show that current efforts
in runtime optimization push the boundaries well towards (and even beyond) native binary
performance. We analyze the results obtained and speculate on the reasons behind some
surprises, rounding the paper off by outlining future possibilities as well as some of our own
research efforts.},

  abstract  = {Today's web-based programming environments has become more multifaceted for accomplishing tasks that go beyond 'browsing' web-pages. The process of developing efficient web-based programs for such a wide array of applications poses a number of challenges to the programming community. Applications possess a number of workload behaviors, ranging from control intensive (e.g., searching, sorting, and parsing) to data intensive (e.g., image processing, simulation and modeling, and data mining). Web-based applications can also be characterized as compute intensive (e.g., iterative methods, numerical methods, and financial modeling), where the overall throughput of the web application is heavily dependent on the computational efficiency of the underlying hardware. Of course, no single architecture is best for running all classes of workloads, and most applications possess a mix of the workload characteristics. For instance, control-intensive applications tend to run faster on the CPU, whereas data-intensive applications tend to run fast on massively parallel architectures (like the GPU), where the same operation is applied to multiple data items concurrently. To extend and support these various workload classes so that browser-based applications wouldn't be hindered, a new generation of API needed to be developed (open the door for developers so that they can access the power of new hardware/technologies). One example of this, is the WebGPU API which exposes the capabilities of GPU hardware for the Web. The course is intended to help you get started with the WebGPU API while understanding both the HOW and WHY behind it works, so you can create your own solutions. This course is designed to teach you the new WebGPU API for graphics and compute techniques without any prior knowledge. All you need is some JavaScript experience and preferably an understanding of basic trigonometry. Whether you're new to graphics and compute development or an old pro, everyone has to start somewhere. Generally, that means starting with the basics which is the focus of this course. You'll learn through simple, easy-to-learn hands-on exercises that help you master the subject. It does this by using multiple task-based activities and discussions which complement and build upon one another.},

  url      = {https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2206/2206.06428.pdf},
  abstract = {With the rapid development of information
transmission, Software as a Service (SaaS) is developing at a
rapid speed that everything originally local tends to be
transplanted onto servers and executed on the cloud. WebGPU is
such a SaaS system that it holds the GPU-equipped server to
execute students’ CUDA code and releases the RESTful front-end
website for students to write their code on. However,
programming on an HTML-based interface is not satisfactory
due to a lack of syntax highlighting and automatic keyword
complement. On the other side, Visual Studio Code is now
becoming the most popular programming interface due to its
strong community and eclectic functionalities. Thus, we propose
such a system that, students write code locally using VS Code
with its coding-auxiliary extensions, and push the code to
WebGPU with only one button pressed using our VSC-WebGPU
extension. The extension is divided into 4 parts: the login process
for automatically logging the student into WebGPU, the pull
process that pulls the code down to the local workspace, the push
process that copies the code to the browser for compiling and
running, and the exit process to exit the browser and close the
connection. This 4-step architecture is also applicable for any
other automated tools to push local code to authorization-
required SaaS systems using Web automata.},

  abstract = {ROOT-Eve (REve), the new generation of the ROOT event-display
module, uses a web server-client model to guarantee exact data translation from
the experiments’ data analysis frameworks to users’ browsers. Data is then
displayed in various views, including high-precision 2D and 3D graphics views,
currently driven by THREE.js rendering engine based on WebGL technology.
RenderCore, a computer graphics research-oriented rendering engine, has been
integrated into REve to optimize rendering performance and enable the use of
state-of-the-art techniques for object highlighting and object selection. It also
allowed for the implementation of optimized instanced rendering through the
usage of custom shaders and rendering pipeline modifications. To further the
impact of this investment and ensure the long-term viability of REve, Render-
Core is being refactored on top of WebGPU, the next-generation GPU interface
for browsers that supports compute shaders, storage textures and introduces
significant improvements in GPU utilization. This has led to optimization of in-
terchange data formats, decreased server-client traffic, and improved offloading
of data visualization algorithms to the GPU. FireworksWeb, a physics analysis-
oriented event display of the CMS experiment, is used to demonstrate the re-
sults, focusing on high-granularity calorimeters and targeting high data-volume
events of heavy-ion collisions and High-Luminosity LHC. The next steps and
directions are also discussed.},
